Lightweight TCP/IP stack(LWIP)
==============================

lwIP is a small independent implementation of the TCP/IP protocol suite.

The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce resource usage while
still having a full scale TCP. This makes lwIP suitable for use in embedded
systems with tens of kilobytes of free RAM and room for around 40 kilobytes
of code ROM.

Features
--------

* Protocols: IP, ICMP, UDP, TCP, IGMP, ARP, PPPoS, PPPoE 
* DHCP client, DNS client, AutoIP/APIPA (Zeroconf), SNMP agent (private MIB support) 
* APIs: specialized APIs for enhanced performance, optional Berkeley-alike socket API 
* Extended features: IP forwarding over multiple network interfaces, TCP congestion control, RTT estimation and fast recovery/fast retransmit 
* Addon applications: HTTP server, SNTP client, SMTP client, ping, NetBIOS nameserver
