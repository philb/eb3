Digital Glue Logic based on Configurable Custom Logic (CCL)
===========================================================

Custom logic driver offers a way to initialize on-chip programmable logic
units, so that a specific logic box is built. Then this "box" can be connected
to internal or external circuit to perform the logic operations.

Features
--------
* Initialization and de-initialization
* Enabling and disabling

Applications
------------
* Connected to external circuit, as a logic operation box, e.g., as adder.

Dependencies
------------
* Programmable logic control units
